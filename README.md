ForeachLoopExamples

This project demonstrates the use of the foreach loop in C#. The foreach loop is particularly useful for iterating over each element in a collection, such as arrays and lists. In this project, you will see how to use foreach to access and manipulate collection elements.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Using foreach with Arrays: Iterating over integer arrays and displaying their elements.
    Using foreach with Lists: Iterating over string lists and displaying their elements.
    Conditional Check within foreach: Identifying even numbers in an array.
    Transforming List Elements: Converting list elements to uppercase while iterating.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Iterating over an array of integers and printing each value.
    Iterating over a list of strings and printing each name.
    Filtering elements in an array to find even numbers.
    Converting each string in a list to uppercase and printing it.

Example Output

    Array elements:
    10 20 30 40 50

    Names list elements:
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie

    Even numbers in the array:
    10 20 30 40 50

    Names in uppercase:
    ALICE
    BOB
    CHARLIE

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file to see the examples of foreach loop usage with arrays and lists.

Purpose

This project is designed for beginners to learn how to use the foreach loop in C# to efficiently work with collections like arrays and lists.
